It will remove the background from your video and insert a new background. So The background in your video should have a even color and it must be a distinct color from the object.

run in the terminal by a commend like :
<q>
 $ python chroma_key.py input_video.mp4  background.png output_video.mp4

<h5>3. Pick color to remove</h5>
</hr>
You can see three window, 'panel_threshold', 'input_video' and 'result'. On the 'input_video' window, left-click the background part you want to remove.
</br>
